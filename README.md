We all know how hard it can be to find the perfect fit for your daily fashion needs; therefore, we bring forward an eco-friendly and affordable clothes renting app for the days where you have <b>NOTHING TO WEAR !!</b> With pocket-friendly charges, you can now rent the clothes of your choice hassle-free.


This project will deal with providing an application-based platform online where users can rent clothing and attire for themselves or put them up for others to rent as well. Moreover, decorative items made from recycled cloth will be for sale too.




The main aim of this project is to make sure no cloth or fabric item gets wasted!
