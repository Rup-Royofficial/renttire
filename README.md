We know how hard it can be to find a a perfect fit for your daily fashion needs, therefore we bring forward an eco-friendly and affordable clothes renting app for the days where you have NOTHING TO WEAR !! With pocket-friendly charges you can now rent the clothes of your choice hassle free .

This project will deal in providing a application based platform online where users can rent clothing and attires for themselves or put them up for others to rent as well. Moreover decoratives made from recycled cloth items will be for sale too.

Main aim of this project is to make sure no cloth or fabric item gets wasted!
